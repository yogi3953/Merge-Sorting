# Merge-Sorting
Merge Sort Algorithm Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that splits an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

# How It Works
Divide: Split the array into two halves.
Conquer: Recursively sort each half.
Merge: Combine the sorted halves back into a single sorted array.
